//Edit these settings to your needs:

$your_facebook_id="your facebook id here";
$your_facebook_app_id="your facebook app here";
$your_wowtal_directory="your wowtal directory here"; //this is the root directory so when people go to /eng folder or /ger folder or any other folder, they will see the same comments. Or other worlds: there will be only one comment version and no separate comments for druids and etc. You can play with it if sou want.

//In my case:
// $your_wowtal_directory="http://freecode.hu/wowtal";
